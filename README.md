# TweetCollector
This is a python application that scrapes tweets from a geotagged location (in this case a box near the Los Angeles area) and displays a heatmap where people are tweeting from. Note: OAuth authentication keys needed and read from "keys.txt"

## Technologies used
- tweepy Twitter API to scrape tweets (https://www.tweepy.org/)
- folium to display map (https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)
- pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation

## Usage
```
python main.py
```
This should begin the script and display the map in the html file
